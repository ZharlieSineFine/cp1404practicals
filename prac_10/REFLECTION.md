# Write some short but thoughtful comments about each of the following:
- regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
        
        There has been a slight improvement in terms of accuracy. Overall it has been pretty consistent.
- regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
        
        Reviewing other's work provides unique insight from different perspectives. My work being reviewed also improves my code.
- regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

        I would include more output prediction questions for practice.
## Include proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
